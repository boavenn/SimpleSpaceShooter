# SimpleSpaceShooter
My attempt to make a simple, enjoyable minigame using C++ and SFML library. I got inspired by another 2D space
shooter called Warblade which I used to play a lot as a child, be sure to check it out :space_invader:

You can watch a quick gameplay [here](https://youtu.be/ys475QWXbcY) :poop:
