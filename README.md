# SSS-SimpleSpaceShooter
My first attempt to make a simple, enjoyable minigame using C++ and SFML library. I got inspired by another 2D space
shooter called Warblade, be sure to check it out :space_invader:

The game was meant to be simple (and it still is, kinda), with two types of enemies and few weapons, but eventually
I ended up adding more and more stuff. That's why some things look like they could be done much better. But I really like
how the game came out to be, actually, pretty good and even challenging at some point. Maybe I will revisit 
this project in the future when I am more familiar with states, GUI and such :alien:

You can watch a 10 min long (sorry!) gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4oAEj9Tl2g):poop:
